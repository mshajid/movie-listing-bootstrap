# Movie Listing Project With Bootstrap 5
In this Project #3, I was able to make movie listing with my personal favorites, and followed the best practices to make the code more readable. This project mobile-first since I used the Bootstrap 5 framework without adding external CSS except internal CSS for override changes.
